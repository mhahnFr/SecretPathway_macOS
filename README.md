#  Welcome to four_Mac_Client!
This repository contains a client for *[four]*, written in Swift for macOS.

## Purpose
The purpose of this client is to provide a fully integrated client for macOS. The default client of [four],
which is written Java, supports multiple platforms, but does not provide the full Look&Feel of a native
Mac-App.

### Final notes
This version of the client is still work in progress.
